    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered a few major LangGraph themes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory\n",
    "* Human-in-the-loop\n",
    "* Controllability\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll bring these ideas together to tackle one of AI's most popular applications: research automation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research is often laborious work offloaded to analysts. AI has considerable potential to assist with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, research demands customization: raw LLM outputs are often poorly suited for real-world decision-making workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Customized, AI-based [research and report generation](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/05/predictions-for-the-future-of-rag/#reports-over-rag) workflows are a promising way to address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a lightweight, multi-agent system around chat models that customizes the research process.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Source Selection` \n",
    "* Users can choose any set of input sources for their research.\n",
    "  \n",
    "`Planning` \n",
    "* Users provide a topic, and the system generates a team of AI analysts, each focusing on one sub-topic.\n",
    "* `Human-in-the-loop` will be used to refine these sub-topics before research begins.\n",
    "  \n",
    "`LLM Utilization`\n",
    "* Each analyst will conduct in-depth interviews with an expert AI using the selected sources.\n",
    "* The interview will be a multi-turn conversation to extract detailed insights as shown in the [STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) paper.\n",
    "* These interviews will be captured in a using `sub-graphs` with their internal state. \n",
    "   \n",
    "`Research Process`\n",
    "* Experts will gather information to answer analyst questions in `parallel`.\n",
    "* And all interviews will be conducted simultaneously through `map-reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Output Format` \n",
    "* The gathered insights from each interview will be synthesized into a final report.\n",
    "* We'll use customizable prompts for the report, allowing for a flexible output format. \n",
    "\n",

(2) **Device-Aware Sharding**: Dynamically partition model parameters/data based on device computational capacity, prioritizing high-capacity devices for compute-intensive layers and balancing workloads via runtime monitoring and adaptive sharding strategies. (3) **Fault Tolerance**: Implement straggler-tolerant synchronization (e.g., asynchronous consensus protocols) and partial failure recovery mechanisms, such as checkpointing and redundant gradient aggregation, to ensure convergence despite hardware variability. Trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and robustness are managed through hybrid strategies that adapt to real-time hardware performance metrics.\n",

Use dependency graph analysis (e.g., graphviz/networkx) to identify independent nodes for parallel execution, leverage asynchronous I/O (async/await) for non-blocking operations, and implement dynamic load balancing (e.g., Ray's custom scheduling). Minimize communication overhead via localized intermediate outputs (shared memory/torch.distributed) and ensure data consistency with checkpointing for fault tolerance.

       "- **Straggler Mitigation**: Gradient averaging or redundant synchronization (e.g., duplicate gradients from fast devices).  \n",
       "- **Checkpointing**: Periodically save model states to recover from partial failures.  \n",
       "- **Fault-Resilient AllReduce**: Use checksums or erasure coding to detect and recover from partial failures.  \n",

       "**Trade-offs**:  \n",
       "- Fault tolerance mechanisms add overhead but ensure convergence in heterogeneous clusters.  \n",
       "- Checkpointing increases storage and computational costs.  \n",

       "**Hybrid Parallelism**:  \n",
       "- Combine data and model parallelism for large models (e.g., 100B+ parameters). Use data parallelism for smaller sub-models and model parallelism for distributed layers.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Pipeline Parallelism**:  \n",
       "- Split the model into stages (e.g., 4 stages) and interleave data batches across stages to hide communication latency.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Gradient Checkpointing & Mixed Precision**:  \n",
       "- Use gradient checkpointing to trade memory for computation (e.g., store activations at checkpoints instead of all layers).  \n",
       "- Combine with mixed precision (FP16/FP8) to reduce memory usage and improve throughput.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Example**: For a 500B-parameter model, use pipeline parallelism with gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage by 60% while maintaining 90% throughput.  \n",

       "**Key Contributions**:  \n",
       "- Highlighted the trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and robustness.  \n",

       "**Focus**: Optimizing node-level dependencies in LangGraph workflows.  \n",
       "**Key Contributions**:  \n",
       "- Emphasized the use of dependency graph analysis (e.g., graphviz/networkx) to identify independent nodes for parallel execution.  \n",
       "- Advocated for asynchronous I/O (async/await) and dynamic load balancing (e.g., Ray’s custom scheduling).  \n",
       "\n",
       "### **Query 3: Hardware Heterogeneity**  \n",
       "**Focus**: Adapting LangGraph to heterogeneous hardware (e.g., TPUs, GPUs).  \n",
       "**Key Contributions**:  \n",
       "- Introduced device-aware sharding and fault-resilient synchronization techniques.  \n",
       "- Demonstrated the importance of runtime monitoring for adaptive sharding strategies.  \n",
