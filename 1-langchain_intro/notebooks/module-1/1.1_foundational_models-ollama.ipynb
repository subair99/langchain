      "### 3. Geography & Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "**Location**  \n",
      "- Mare Tranquillitatis was chosen for its basaltic, relatively flat terrain and its proximity to large deposits of water ice at depths of 40–50 m.  \n",
      "- The city sits within a natural shallow basin, which reduces the need for extensive excavation and allows the construction of a “ring‑habitat” structure that embraces the central water‑ice extraction well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Structural Design**  \n",
      "- **Habitat Ring**: 8 km in circumference, 300 m wide, segmented into 12 modules (each ~ 700 m² per module). Modules are made from *regolith‑sintered composites* (a mix of lunar soil and binder that, when sintered, forms a dense, load‑bearing material).  \n",
      "- **Central Core**: Houses the *Lunar Parliament*, *Supreme Court*, *City Hall*, *Cultural Center*, *Hospital*, and *main transport hub*. Built in a dome of 200 m radius, lined with titanium alloy and a multi‑layer thermal shield.  \n",
      "- **Sub‑Modules**: Surrounding the core are industrial zones (Helium‑3 extraction, solar array assembly, biotech labs), residential quarters, hydroponic farms, and recreational parks.  \n",
      "- **Radiation Shielding**: The outer layer of the habitat ring is a 15 cm regolith shell, supplemented by *active magnetic shielding* (thin superconducting coils generating a local magnetic field to deflect charged particles).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Urban Planning**  \n",
      "- Streets are largely underground to protect inhabitants from micrometeorite impacts.  \n",
      "- The *Sun Path Corridor* – a 200 m wide boulevard lined with solar cells that doubles as an energy generator.  \n",
      "- Parks are designed as “gravity‑simulated” zones: a mix of vertical gardens, floating sculptures, and low‑gravity sports fields.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Governance & Politics\n",

      "- The mayor is elected by the council (a parliamentary system).  \n",
      "- LACC also serves as the liaison with the *International Lunar Authority* (ILA), which governs the entire lunar territory.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Legal Framework**  \n",
      "- The *Lunar Charter* (signed in 2047) sets the legal basis: sovereignty is shared among signatory nations; Luna City is a *free city-state* under the ILA’s jurisdiction.  \n",
      "- *The Lunar Code of Conduct* addresses property, commerce, environmental protection, and citizen rights.  \n",
      "\n",
