Daniel Lurie was born and raised in San Francisco. From his leadership at Tipping Point Community to the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee, Daniel has a proven track record of public service and a longstanding commitment to improving the lives of San Franciscans.

Under his direction, Tipping Point raised over $500 million to house, employ, educate, and support hundreds of thousands of Bay Area families.
