The city is a hotbed of innovation, with numerous research institutions, laboratories, and cutting-edge technology facilities. Visitors can explore the Lunar Museum of History, which showcases the moon's fascinating geological and astronomical past, or visit the renowned Lunar Academy of Arts and Sciences, which attracts talented individuals from all over the solar system.\n",
