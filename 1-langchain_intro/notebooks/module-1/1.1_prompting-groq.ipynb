      "| Year (Earth) | Milestone |\n",
      "|--------------|-----------|\n",
      "| 2035 | First permanent research outpost (Artemis‑3) established in Mare Imbrium. |\n",
      "| 2052 | The “Regolith Accord” creates the Lunar Settlement Charter, granting self‑governance to lunar colonies. |\n",
      "| 2078 | The **Luna‑City Initiative** consolidates scattered habitats into a single, interconnected megastructure. |\n",
      "| 2094 | The capital is officially named **Lunaris Prime** after a popular vote. |\n",
      "| 2101 | Completion of the **Craters Hall** and the **Solaris Dome**, marking the city’s functional independence. |\n",
      "| 2120 | First lunar‑born child is born in Lunaris Prime, cementing the Moon’s status as a true homeworld. |\n",

      "\n",
      "Lunaris Prime is built as a **radial megastructure** that hugs the interior walls of a massive, partially excavated crater—**Mare Imbrium’s “Crown Basin.”** The design balances three core principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Radiation Shielding** – Thick layers of regolith (up to 12 m) line the outer walls, supplemented by graphene‑reinforced polymer panels.  \n",
      "2. **Closed‑Loop Life Support** – Every district recycles air, water, and waste through bio‑reactors that use engineered algae and extremophile microbes.  \n",
      "3. **Earth‑Moon Connectivity** – A network of maglev “Luna‑Rails” links the capital to other lunar settlements, while the **Eclipse Port** handles cargo and passenger traffic to Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Major Districts\n",
      "\n",
      "| District | Highlights |\n",
      "|----------|------------|\n",
      "| **Craters Hall** | Governmental hub; houses the Lunar Commonwealth Council, the Supreme Archive (a quantum‑indexed library of all lunar knowledge), and the Hall of Mirrors (a cultural center with holographic art). |\n",
      "| **Solaris Dome** | The largest transparent dome on the Moon, powered by a lattice of thin‑film solar panels. Inside, a climate‑controlled biosphere supports forests, farms, and recreation areas. |\n",
      "| **Regolith Market** | A bustling bazaar where Earth‑imported goods, lunar‑crafted tools, and exotic “space‑cuisine” are traded. The market’s central atrium features a zero‑gravity fountain of ionized plasma. |\n",
      "| **Starlight Quarters** | Residential zone with modular habitats that can be reconfigured as families grow. Each unit has a “view‑port” that projects live Earth vistas or deep‑space panoramas. |\n",
      "| **Neuro‑Forge** | The industrial heart: 3‑D‑printed habitats, mining equipment, and AI‑run fabrication plants. The Forge’s exhaust is filtered and fed back into the city’s life‑support loops. |\n",
      "| **Luna‑Port** | The primary launch/landing complex, equipped with electromagnetic launch pads for cargo shuttles and a “Sky‑Dock” for passenger liners traveling to Earth, Mars, and the asteroid belt. |\n",
      "| **Echo Gardens** | A cultural district with theaters, museums, and the **Lunar Symphony Hall**, where music is composed using the Moon’s natural resonances (the “lunar bells” of basaltic cliffs). |\n",

      "### Everyday Life in Lunaris Prime\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Gravity:** Residents experience 1/6 g, so daily routines are adapted—exercise rigs, magnetic footwear, and “float‑commutes” (personal levitation pods) are common.  \n",
      "- **Timekeeping:** The city follows **Lunar Standard Time (LST)**, a 24‑hour cycle synchronized with Earth’s UTC but offset by the Moon’s 27.3‑day orbital period for cultural festivals.  \n",
      "- **Food:** Hydroponic wheat, algae‑based protein, and “Moon‑berries” (genetically‑engineered strawberries that thrive in low‑light conditions) dominate the diet, supplemented by occasional Earth imports.  \n",
      "- **Transportation:** Residents zip around on maglev pods, personal hover‑skates, or the occasional rover for longer trips outside the dome.  \n",
      "- **Culture:** Lunar holidays celebrate the **First Light** (the day the first human set foot on the Moon) and **Eclipse Night**, when Earth’s shadow passes over the city, plunging it into a spectacular, star‑filled darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why It’s Called the “Capital”\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Political Center:** All lunar legislation, diplomacy, and inter‑planetary treaties are negotiated here.  \n",
      "- **Economic Engine:** The Regolith Market and Neuro‑Forge make Lunaris Prime the financial heart of the Moon’s economy.  \n",
      "- **Cultural Beacon:** From the Echo Gardens to the Solaris Dome’s gardens, the city is the primary source of lunar art, science, and identity.  \n",
      "- **Symbolic Anchor:** Situated at the very point where Earth hangs directly overhead, Lunaris Prime embodies humanity’s bridge between its home planet and the new frontier.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Fun Fact\n",
      "\n",
      "During a total lunar eclipse, the **Eclipse Port’s** reflective panels are angled to capture Earthshine, creating a natural “moon‑lit” glow that bathes the city in a soft, amber light. Residents gather in the Solaris Dome’s central plaza for the **“Silver Serenade,”** a nightly concert where musicians play instruments tuned to the subtle vibrations of the Moon’s crust—producing sounds no Earth‑bound ear has ever heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, while the Moon may not have a capital in the real world—yet—imagine Lunaris Prime rising from the regolith, a shining testament to humanity’s reach for the stars.**\n"
