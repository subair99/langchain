      "4. **Veggies** – Toss in the frozen veg (no need to thaw) and stir‑fry 2‑3 min.  \n",
      "5. **Egg (if using)** – Push the veggies to one side, crack the eggs into the empty space, scramble quickly, then mix through.  \n",
      "6. **Add chicken & rice** – Add the shredded chicken and rice. Stir‑fry, pressing the rice against the pan so it gets a little crisp on the bottom (about 3‑4 min).  \n",
      "7. **Season** – Drizzle soy sauce, oyster/fish sauce, and sesame oil over the mixture. Toss everything together and taste; add more soy sauce, salt, or pepper as needed.  \n",
