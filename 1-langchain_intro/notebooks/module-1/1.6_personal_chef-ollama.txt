---

### Instructions

1. **Prep the peanut drizzle**
   1. In a small bowl, whisk together peanut butter, rice vinegar, honey, and 2 Tbsp water until smooth.
   2. Set aside. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash more water until it reaches a pourable consistency.

2. **Sauté aromatics**
   1. Heat the skillet over medium heat. Add a splash of oil (olive or coconut).
   2. Add minced garlic and grated ginger; sauté 30 s until fragrant.
   3. Toss in diced red bell pepper and carrot; cook 2–3 min until slightly softened.

3. **Add the rice & chicken**
   1. Stir in the leftover rice and shredded chicken.
   2. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth.
   3. Add soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes.
   4. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally.
   5. Let it cook for 5–7 min, allowing the rice to absorb the coconut‑soy mixture and become creamy.

4. **Finish the sauce**
   1. Stir in the thawed peas and half of the chopped cilantro.
   2. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   3. If you like a little extra tang, squeeze in the lime juice and sprinkle some zest.

5. **Serve**
   1. Spoon the creamy mixture into bowls or plates.
   2. Drizzle the peanut sauce over the top.
   3. Garnish with the remaining cilantro, sliced green onions, toasted sesame seeds, or crushed peanuts if desired.
   4. Add a wedge of lime on the side for an extra burst of citrus.

### Tips & Variations

| Idea | How to Do It |
|------|--------------|
| **Make it a taco bowl** | Use the same base, but serve over a bed of lettuce or tortilla chips. Top with avocado slices, salsa, and a dollop of sour cream. |
| **Add a protein boost** | Stir in a handful of edamame or a fried egg for extra protein. |
| **Make it vegan** | Replace chicken with tofu or tempeh, and use a plant‑based coconut milk. |
| **Spice it up** | Add a tablespoon of sriracha or a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce. |
| **Use different grains** | Swap rice for quinoa, couscous, or even cauliflower rice for a low‑carb version. |
