**Recipe: Coconut‑Lime Chicken‑Rice Stuffed Bell Peppers**
*A bright, tropical spin on your leftover chicken and rice that’s quick, one‑pan (plus a baking sheet), and perfect for a creative week‑night dinner.*

---

### Why this works
- **Leftover chicken** stays juicy because it’s mixed with a light sauce rather than being reheated dry.
- **Leftover rice** gets a fresh texture when tossed with coconut milk, lime zest, and a splash of soy sauce.
- **Bell peppers** act as edible “bowls,” giving the dish color, crunch, and a built‑in serving vessel.
- The recipe comes together in **under 30 minutes** and only needs pantry staples plus a few fresh aromatics.

## Step‑by‑Step Instructions

1. **Pre‑heat & prep the peppers**
   - Set oven to **400 °F (200 °C)**.
   - Slice the tops off the bell peppers and remove seeds/pith. If you like a softer pepper, give them a quick **2‑minute boil** in salted water, then drain and pat dry; otherwise, place them raw for a crisp bite.
   - Arrange the peppers upright on a baking sheet.

2. **Make the coconut‑lime sauce** *(≈5 min)*
   - In a small saucepan over medium heat, add **1 Tbsp oil** and sauté the **garlic** and **ginger** for 30 seconds until fragrant. 
   - Stir in **coconut milk, lime juice, lime zest, soy sauce, fish sauce (if using), and a pinch of red‑pepper flakes**. Simmer 2‑3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.
   - Season with **salt & pepper** to taste; remove from heat.

3. **Combine leftovers with sauce** *(≈3 min)*
   - In a large bowl, toss the **leftover chicken** and **rice** with the warm coconut‑lime sauce until everything is evenly coated. 
   - Fold in **green onions** and **half the cilantro**. Taste and adjust seasoning (extra lime, soy, or a dash more salt if needed).

4. **Stuff the peppers** *(≈2 min)*
   - Spoon the chicken‑rice mixture into each bell pepper, packing gently but leaving a little space at the top (the filling will puff a bit while baking).
   - Drizzle any remaining sauce from the bowl over the tops.

5. **Bake** *(≈15 min)*
   - Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake **15 minutes**, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through and slightly golden on the edges.
   - If you love a crispier top, switch to **broil** for the last 2 minutes—watch closely so it doesn’t burn.

6. **Finish & serve** *(≈2 min)*
   - Remove from oven and let rest **2 minutes**.
   - Sprinkle the remaining **cilantro**, **crushed peanuts** or **toasted coconut**, and an extra squeeze of lime if you like extra zing.
   - Serve the peppers whole or slide the stuffing onto a plate with a side salad.

## Tips & Variations

| Idea | How to do it |
|------|--------------|
| **Add veggies** | Toss in a handful of frozen peas, corn, or shredded carrots with the rice before stuffing. |
| **Spicy** | Mix 1 tsp sriracha or a chopped Thai bird‑chili into the sauce. |
| **Herb‑infused** | Substitute lime with orange zest and add a splash of fish sauce for a Thai‑inspired flavor. |
| **Cheesy twist** | Sprinkle ¼ cup shredded mozzarella on top before the last 5 minutes of baking. |
| **Low‑fat** | Use light coconut milk and reduce oil; the sauce will still stay creamy thanks to the rice. |

### Quick “Chef’s Note”

If you’re short on time, **skip the oven**: simply heat the sauce, toss with chicken and rice, and serve the mixture over raw or lightly sautéed pepper strips. The baked version, however, gives a lovely caramelized edge and a “comfort‑food” feel that makes the leftovers feel brand‑new.

Enjoy your bright, tropical‑styled stuffed peppers! Bon appétit!
