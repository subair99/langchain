**Spicy Chicken‑Rice Arancini with Coconut‑Lime Dipping Sauce**
*A crunchy‑on‑the‑outside, cheesy‑on‑the‑inside snack that turns plain leftovers into a restaurant‑quality bite.*

---

## Why this works

* **Leftover rice** (especially day‑old) holds together better when formed into balls – the classic fried‑rice technique (see the chicken fried‑rice guide) 【2†L1-L4】.
* **Shredded leftover chicken** mixes easily with the rice and adds protein without extra cooking.
* **Arancini** (Italian rice‑ball fritters) are a perfect vehicle for stuffing cheese and flavor‑boosters, and the YouTube “Cheesy Chicken Rice Arancini” shows the basic shape and coating 【1†L1-L3】.
* The coconut‑lime sauce adds a fresh, tropical contrast that makes the dish feel totally new.

## Step‑by‑Step Instructions

### 1. Prep the rice‑chicken mixture
1. **Break up the rice** with your fingers so no large clumps remain (cold rice is easier to handle).
2. In a large bowl combine the rice, shredded chicken, mozzarella, Parmesan, green onions, red‑pepper flakes, garlic powder, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
3. **Taste and season** with salt & pepper. The soy sauce already adds salt, so add only a pinch if needed.
4. **Mix thoroughly** until the cheese is evenly distributed – the cheese will melt inside the arancini, creating a gooey core.

### 2. Form the arancini balls
1. **Set up a breading station**: one shallow dish with flour, a second with a beaten egg, and a third with panko breadcrumbs.
2. Wet your hands, scoop about 2 Tbsp of the rice‑chicken mixture, and **shape into a compact ball** (≈ 1½ inches diameter).
3. **Coat**: roll the ball in flour (shakes off excess), dip in egg, then roll in panko, pressing gently so the crumbs adhere.
4. **Repeat** for all the mixture; you should get ~12‑14 balls. Place the coated balls on a plate and **refrigerate 15 minutes** – this helps the coating stay intact while frying.

### 3. Fry the arancini
1. Heat **2‑3 cups of vegetable oil** in a heavy skillet over medium‑high heat until it reaches **350 °F (175 °C)** (a small breadcrumb dropped in should sizzle and turn golden in ~30 seconds).
2. Working in batches, **slide the chilled balls** into the oil (don’t overcrowd). Fry for **3‑4 minutes**, turning gently, until the coating is deep‑golden and crisp.
3. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper‑towel‑lined plate to drain. Keep warm in a low oven (200 °F) while you finish the rest.

### 4. Make the coconut‑lime sauce
1. In a small saucepan, combine coconut milk, lime juice, zest, honey, fish sauce, ginger, and chili‑garlic paste (if using).
2. Bring to a **gentle simmer** over low heat, stirring occasionally, for **3‑4 minutes** until slightly thickened.
3. Taste and adjust: add a pinch more salt, a splash more lime juice, or a drizzle of honey if you prefer sweeter balance. Remove from heat.

### 5. Serve
* Arrange the golden arancini on a platter.
* Serve with the warm coconut‑lime dipping sauce in a small bowl.
* Garnish with extra lime zest, a few chopped cilantro leaves, or a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds for texture.

## Tips & Variations

| Tip | Why it helps |
|-----|--------------|
| **Use day‑old rice** | Drier grains hold together better and give a firmer bite (the fried‑rice principle). |
| **Add a surprise filling** | Slip a small cube of mozzarella or a spoonful of salsa verde into the center before coating for an extra burst. |
| **Bake instead of fry** | For a lighter version, brush the coated balls with oil and bake at 425 °F for 15‑18 minutes, turning once, until crisp. |
| **Swap the sauce** | A spicy sriracha‑mayonnaise or a tangy tamarind chutney also pairs nicely. |
| **Make it vegan** | Replace chicken with roasted chickpeas or smoked tofu and use vegan cheese; keep the coconut‑lime sauce. |
