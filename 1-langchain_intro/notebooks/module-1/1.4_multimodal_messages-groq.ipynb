      "**Capital of the Moon – Selene‑Prime**\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "- **Official Name:** Selene‑Prime (often shortened to *Selene* or *The Prime*)\n",
      "- **Coordinates:** 0° N, 0° E (the lunar “equator” at the center of the Mare Imbrium basin)\n",
      "- **Population:** ~12 million permanent residents (humans, lunar‑born hybrids, and a growing number of sentient AI constructs)\n",
      "- **Governance:** The Lunar Commonwealth Council (LCC), a rotating body of elected representatives from the Moon’s six major domes plus a council of AI overseers.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Geography & Layout\n",
      "Selene‑Prime is built within a massive, partially‑buried crater known as **The Sapphire Basin**, whose rim rises 2 km above the surrounding mare. The city’s core sits on a **levitating basaltic platform** that hovers 150 m above the regolith, kept aloft by a lattice of superconducting maglev fields powered by fusion‑helium reactors buried deep beneath the rim.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **The Dome Districts:** Six concentric, climate‑controlled domes (Terra, Aurora, Nexus, Helios, Verdant, and Echo) each specialize in a different function—residential life, scientific research, commerce, energy, agriculture, and culture.\n",
      "- **The Sky‑Rail Loop:** A transparent mag‑lev rail circles the entire city, offering panoramic views of Earth and the stars while shuttling commuters at 250 km/h.\n",
      "- **The Regolith Gardens:** Terraced gardens carved into the crater walls, irrigated by recycled melt‑water and illuminated by bioluminescent algae panels, provide fresh food and a rare taste of “green” on the Moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Architecture & Aesthetics\n",
      "- **Materials:** Regolith‑derived sintered glass, carbon‑nanotube composites, and **lunar basalt fiber** (a super‑strong, lightweight material mined locally).\n",
      "- **Style:** A blend of sleek Neo‑Constructivism and organic biomimicry—buildings rise like crystalline spires that pulse with low‑frequency light, echoing the Moon’s subtle radio emissions.\n",
      "- **Iconic Structures:**\n",
      "  - **The Lunar Spire:** A 1 km tall, tapering tower that houses the LCC chambers, the Hall of Echoes (a concert hall that uses lunar dust as an acoustic medium), and the **Observatory of the Eternal Night**, the most powerful deep‑space telescope ever built.\n",
      "  - **The Sea‑Glass Plaza:** A public square paved with translucent basalt that glows softly at night, reflecting Earth’s blue disc as it rises and sets.\n",
      "  - **The Gravity Gardens:** A series of rotating habitats that simulate Earth‑like gravity for recreation and research, their inner surfaces covered in kinetic tiles that harvest movement energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Culture & Society\n",
      "- **Language:** A creole of Earth languages called **Lunish**, peppered with technical jargon and a rich set of emojis transmitted via retinal implants.\n",
      "- **Festivals:**\n",
      "  - **Eclipse Reverie:** Every lunar eclipse is celebrated with a city‑wide light show where the Spire’s façade projects holographic stories of humanity’s first steps on the Moon.\n",
      "  - **Harvest of the Regolith:** A seasonal festival marking the completion of the annual hydroponic harvest, featuring floating food markets and zero‑g culinary competitions.\n",
      "- **Arts:** “Dust‑sculpture” has become a celebrated medium—artists carve intricate figures directly into the fine lunar dust, which are then frozen into glass‑like panels for display.\n",
      "- **Religion/Philosophy:** Many residents follow **Seleneism**, a belief system that reveres the Moon as the “Mother of Light,” emphasizing balance between technology and the stark beauty of the lunar environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Economy & Technology\n",
      "- **Primary Industries:** Helium‑3 extraction, quantum‑communication relays, deep‑space launch services, and high‑precision manufacturing of zero‑gravity alloys.\n",
      "- **Trade:** Selene‑Prime exports **Helium‑3 fuel cells**, **lunar basalt fiber**, and **AI‑curated data streams** to Earth and the Martian colonies; imports include food, cultural artifacts, and rare Earth metals.\n",
      "- **Transportation:** \n",
      "  - **Luna‑Liners:** Sub‑orbital shuttles that dock at the **Lunar Port**—a massive orbital tether system that connects Selene‑Prime to the **Earth‑Moon Gateway**.\n",
      "  - **Personal Mobility:** Low‑gravity hover‑pods and magnetic sleds that zip along the crater rim’s railways.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Security & Defense\n",
      "- **The Sentinel Array:** A network of autonomous defense drones orbiting the Moon, equipped with electromagnetic pulse emitters and kinetic interceptors, primarily to protect the capital from rogue meteoroids and any hostile entities.\n",
      "- **Legal System:** The **Lunar Charter**, a living document that is updated every lunar year by the LCC and AI overseers, balances individual freedoms with the collective need for resource stewardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Selene‑Prime Matters\n",
      "Selene‑Prime isn’t just a bureaucratic hub; it’s the symbolic heart of humanity’s next great leap. It stands as a testament to what can be achieved when **earthbound ambition meets the stark, inspiring silence of the Moon**. From its levitating platforms to its glowing gardens, the capital is a living reminder that even on a world without atmosphere, civilization can bloom—bright, resilient, and forever looking up at the stars.\n"
