      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so the user is asking, \"What's the capital of the Moon?\" Hmm, that's an interesting question. Let me start by breaking it down. First, I need to recall if the Moon has any recognized capital. From what I know, the Moon is Earth's natural satellite and doesn't have a government or a population, so the concept of a capital city wouldn't apply in the traditional sense. But maybe there's a symbolic or fictional answer here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that in some science fiction stories or movies, they might imagine lunar colonies with names for their cities. For example, in the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" there's a mention of a lunar base, but I don't think they name a capital. There's also the idea of a \"Moonbase Alpha\" from the TV series \"Space: 1999,\" but again, not sure if that's considered a capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe there's a real-world example. I think NASA or other space agencies have proposed names for potential lunar bases. For instance, the Artemis program by NASA aims to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon. They might have a name for a base, but I don't recall if it's called a capital. Alternatively, the European Space Agency (ESA) has plans for a Moon village, but again, not a capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: sometimes places on the Moon are named after historical figures or events. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is responsible for naming features on celestial bodies. They have a list of lunar features, but those are craters, mountains, etc., not cities or capitals. So maybe the user is thinking of a fictional or proposed name.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's a humorous or metaphorical answer. For example, in some contexts, people might jokingly refer to a place like \"Lunopolis\" as the capital, but that's not official. Alternatively, maybe a science fiction reference. The book \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" by Robert A. Heinlein features a lunar colony with a government, but I don't remember the name of the capital there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, there's also the concept of a \"Lunar Capital\" in some speculative discussions about future colonization. For example, if a country establishes a base on the Moon, they might name it something like \"Nova Roma\" or \"New York,\" but again, that's speculative.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the answer is that the Moon doesn't have an official capital because it's not a sovereign entity. However, in fictional or proposed contexts, there might be names used for lunar bases or colonies. The user might be looking for a creative or humorous answer, or perhaps they're referencing a specific work of fiction. I should mention that there's no official capital, but also note any fictional examples if they exist.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moon does not have an official capital because it is not a sovereign entity with a government or population. However, in fictional or speculative contexts, various names have been proposed for lunar settlements or bases. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fictional References**:  \n",
      "   - In science fiction, works like *2001: A Space Odyssey* or *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* by Robert A. Heinlein imagine lunar colonies, but none specifically name a \"capital.\"  \n",
      "   - The TV series *Space: 1999* features a lunar base called \"Moonbase Alpha,\" though it’s not a capital in the traditional sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proposed Lunar Bases**:  \n",
      "   - NASA’s **Artemis program** and the European Space Agency’s **Moon Village** concepts focus on establishing sustainable human presence, but no official \"capital\" has been named.  \n",
      "   - Some speculative ideas suggest names like **Lunopolis** or **Nova Roma** for future lunar cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Humorous/Metaphorical Answers**:  \n",
      "   - Jokingly, people might refer to \"Armstrong City\" (after Neil Armstrong) or \"Lunaville\" as playful names for a lunar capital.  \n",
      "   - The IAU (International Astronomical Union) names lunar features (e.g., craters, mountains), but not cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, while the Moon has no real capital, creative or fictional works often invent names for lunar settlements. If you’re thinking of a specific story or concept, feel free to share more details! 🌕\n"
